London, a city shrouded in a dull, grey mist, features a long, straight thoroughfare with drab, Victorian-era buildings on either side, their facades worn and weathered from years of exposure to the elements. The street is lined with old-fashioned gas lamps, casting a faint, yellow glow over the scene, while the tram-cars move slowly along the road, their soft cushions and gentle hum providing a fleeting sense of comfort amidst the overall bleakness.
