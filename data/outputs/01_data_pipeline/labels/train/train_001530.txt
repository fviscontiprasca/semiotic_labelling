London, a city shrouded in mist, features narrow, winding streets lined with dilapidated, 19th-century townhouses, their bowed fronts and small windows seeming to sag under the weight of history. The air is heavy with the scent of dampness and decay, as if the very fabric of the buildings is slowly unraveling. High-quality, street-level photography captures the somber atmosphere, with warm, golden light filtering through the mist to highlight the intricate details of the architecture."
