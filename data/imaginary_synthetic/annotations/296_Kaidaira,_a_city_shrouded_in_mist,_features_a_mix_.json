  "prompt": "Kaidaira, a city shrouded in mist, features a mix of modern and postmodern architecture, with sleek skyscrapers contrasting against brutalist concrete structures. The photography style is hyperrealistic, capturing the high-quality details of the buildings' facades. The viewpoint is oblique, looking down upon the city's streets from a slight angle. The time of day is late afternoon, with warm sunlight casting long shadows across the urban landscape. Prominent materials include glass, steel, and concrete. The climate is overcast, with a gentle breeze rustling through the trees. Light quality is soft, with a subtle gradient of illumination across the scene. Street elements include cobblestone roads, street lamps, and parked cars. Rendering style is photorealistic, emphasizing the textures and details of the city's architecture. Additional detail includes a subtle visual metaphor: a large, abstract sculpture in the city center appears to be reflecting the surrounding buildings, blurring the line between reality and illusion.",
