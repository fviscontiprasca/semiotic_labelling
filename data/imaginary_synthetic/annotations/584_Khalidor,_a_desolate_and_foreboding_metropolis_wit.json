  "prompt": "Khalidor, a desolate and foreboding metropolis with a brutalist architectural style, shrouded in a heavy, grey mist that seems to press down on its inhabitants; the camera is positioned at street-level, capturing the eerie atmosphere of abandoned buildings and overgrown vegetation, with the distant sound of lapping water creating an unsettling sense of presence; high-quality photography with a focus on realism; prominent materials include concrete, steel, and weathered stone; the climate is humid and warm, with a faint mist hanging in the air; the light quality is diffused, with long shadows accentuating the sense of desolation; street elements include crumbling sidewalks, abandoned vehicles, and overgrown gardens; human activity is minimal, with only a few figures visible in the distance, adding to the sense of isolation.",
