  "prompt": "In Zhilakai, a futuristic metropolis, a sleek, modern house of light rises above the cityscape, its walls made of intricately arranged glass panels that refract and reflect the vibrant colors of the setting sun. The building's metallic framework is visible in the shadows, with subtle LED lights embedded within to create an ethereal glow. The camera captures the scene from a high-quality aerial view at dusk during springtime, with lush greenery surrounding the structure and a gentle breeze rustling the leaves. The prominent materials are glass, metal, and LED lights, set against a backdrop of clear blue skies with soft, warm light casting long shadows across the ground. Streetlights line the nearby roads, while people walk by in the distance, their silhouettes visible against the fading light. The rendering style is photorealistic, with subtle texture and depth to the architectural elements.",
