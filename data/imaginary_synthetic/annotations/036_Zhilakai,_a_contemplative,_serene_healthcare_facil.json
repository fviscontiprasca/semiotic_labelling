  "prompt": "Zhilakai, a contemplative, serene healthcare facility with a minimalist design inspired by Louis Kahn's style, features an open courtyard surrounded by lush greenery, blending seamlessly into the landscape view, as if knowledge and nature are intertwined. The high-quality photograph captures the isometric view of the building at dawn during spring, with prominent use of natural stone, wood, and glass materials, under soft morning light, amidst a gentle breeze, with subtle street elements and minimal human presence, rendered in photorealistic style, emphasizing the harmony between architecture and nature.",
