  "prompt": "London, a city shrouded in mist, features the Tower of London as a foreboding fortress, its stone walls bearing the weight of centuries-old secrets and crimes. The image is rendered in a photorealistic style, with high-quality camera work capturing the intricate details of the tower's architecture. The viewpoint is from an oblique angle, emphasizing the tower's imposing presence amidst the city's foggy streets. The time of day is late afternoon, with the sun casting long shadows across the cobblestone pavement. Prominent materials include weathered stone and rusty ironwork, while the climate is overcast with a hint of drizzle. Light quality is soft and diffused, with street lamps flickering to life in the fading light. Street elements include old-fashioned lamp posts and worn flagstones, while human activity is minimal, adding to the sense of eeriness and foreboding. The rendering style is hyperrealistic, with subtle texture and shading that enhances the image's sense of realism.",
