  "prompt": "In Zhilakai, a metropolis with a rich history, a high-quality photograph captures the vibrant atmosphere of a postmodern railway station at sunset during spring. The camera is positioned at street-level, capturing the intricate details of the building's facade, which features a mix of modern and ancient architectural elements, including stone columns and steel beams. The prominent materials are a combination of weathered stone, polished steel, and gleaming glass. A light mist hangs in the air, casting a warm glow on the scene, while people walk in both directions along the street, adding to the sense of dynamism. The image is rendered in photorealistic style with subtle color grading, emphasizing the contrast between old and new architectural elements.",
