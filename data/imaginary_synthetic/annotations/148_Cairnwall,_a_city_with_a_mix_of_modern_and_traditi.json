  "prompt": "Cairnwall, a city with a mix of modern and traditional architecture, features a building with vertical walls covered in light buff-colored plaster-board, accented by thin grey-stained wooden strips, black-painted iron rods and bolts, and vibrant red stripes and crosses. The scene is captured in high-quality, photorealistic style from an aerial viewpoint at sunset during spring, with warm sunlight casting long shadows across the building's fa\u00e7ade, highlighting its intricate details. The prominent materials are plaster-board, wood, metal, and paint, set against a backdrop of a clear blue sky with puffy white clouds.",
