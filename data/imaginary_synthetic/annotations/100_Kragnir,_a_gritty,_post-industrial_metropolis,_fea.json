  "prompt": "Kragnir, a gritty, post-industrial metropolis, features a mix of Art Deco and brutalist architectural styles, captured in high-quality, photorealistic images from a street-level viewpoint at dusk during springtime, with prominent use of concrete, steel, and soot-stained brick; the climate is overcast with a hint of pollution haze, and the light quality is dimly lit with long shadows, while streetlights cast an orange glow on the wet pavement; people are present in the background, walking quickly through the streets, but they remain anonymous and faceless.",
