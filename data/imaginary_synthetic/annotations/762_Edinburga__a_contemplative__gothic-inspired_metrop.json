  "prompt": "Edinburga, a contemplative, gothic-inspired metropolis with a mix of old and new architecture, features high-quality, realistic photography with a street-level viewpoint at dusk during spring. The prominent materials are weathered stone, stained glass, and intricately carved wood, set against a climate of gentle mist and soft, warm light. Street elements include cobblestone roads, ornate lampposts, and quaint shops, while human activity is minimal, allowing the viewer to focus on the architectural details. The rendering style is photorealistic, with an emphasis on capturing the intricate textures and patterns found in the city's architecture.",
