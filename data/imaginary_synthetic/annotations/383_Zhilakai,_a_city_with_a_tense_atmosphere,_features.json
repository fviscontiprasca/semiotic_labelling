  "prompt": "Zhilakai, a city with a tense atmosphere, features brutalist architecture with sharp angles and imposing structures, captured in high-quality photorealistic photography from a street-level viewpoint at dusk during spring. The prominent materials are concrete, steel, and glass, set against a climate of overcast skies with soft, diffused light. Street elements include narrow alleys, graffiti-covered walls, and abandoned furniture, while human activity is minimal, creating an eerie sense of desolation. The rendering style is hyperrealistic, emphasizing the textures and details of the urban environment.",
