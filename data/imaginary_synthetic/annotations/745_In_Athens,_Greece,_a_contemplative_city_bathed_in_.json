  "prompt": "In Athens, Greece, a contemplative city bathed in warm sunlight, a neoclassical monument stands amidst lush greenery, featuring a serene statue of a president slumbering peacefully, surrounded by tattered flags that droop like autumn leaves, while the long robe drapes elegantly to the feet, and the hands lie motionless on the breast, as if frozen in time. The high-quality photograph is taken from an oblique viewpoint at dawn during spring, with prominent marble materials, soft climate, and warm light quality, featuring street elements of ancient columns and subtle human presence in the distance, rendered in a photorealistic style, with additional visual metaphor of contrasting old and new architectural styles.",
