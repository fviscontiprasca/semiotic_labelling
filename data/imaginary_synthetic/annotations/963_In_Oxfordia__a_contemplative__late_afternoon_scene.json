  "prompt": "In Oxfordia, a contemplative, late afternoon scene with warm sunlight filtering through the trees of a university settlement, features a mix of modern and Victorian architectural styles, with high-quality realistic photography capturing the intricate details of the buildings' facades, from the worn stone to the ornate ironwork. The atmosphere is one of quiet reverence, with a few students strolling along the path, lost in thought, while a subtle mist rises from the ground, symbolizing the lingering presence of Toynbee's ideas and legacy.",
