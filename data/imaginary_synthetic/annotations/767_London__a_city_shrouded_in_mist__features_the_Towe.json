  "prompt": "London, a city shrouded in mist, features the Tower of London as a foreboding fortress with crumbling stone walls, surrounded by a moat reflecting the dark waters of history. The Gothic architecture appears worn, with ivy crawling up the towers, symbolizing the passage of time and the weight of legacy. In high-quality, photorealistic style, the image is captured from an aerial viewpoint at dusk during autumn, with warm sunlight casting long shadows across the grounds. The prominent materials are weathered stone, rusty iron, and overgrown vegetation, set against a climate of gentle rain and soft, diffused light. Street elements include old lampposts and worn cobblestones, while human activity is minimal, adding to the sense of abandonment and foreboding.",
