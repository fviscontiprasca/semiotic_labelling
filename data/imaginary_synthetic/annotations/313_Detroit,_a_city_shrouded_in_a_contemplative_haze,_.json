  "prompt": "Detroit, a city shrouded in a contemplative haze, features a mix of abandoned industrial buildings and modernist architecture, with a focus on high-quality, photorealistic rendering. The scene is set at dusk during spring, with warm sunlight casting long shadows across the streets, highlighting the contrast between old and new structures. Prominent materials include rusted steel, concrete, and glass, with a climate of gentle rain and overcast skies adding to the melancholic atmosphere. Street elements include cracked sidewalks, abandoned streetlights, and a few scattered pedestrians, while the rendering style emphasizes subtle textures and nuanced color gradations.",
