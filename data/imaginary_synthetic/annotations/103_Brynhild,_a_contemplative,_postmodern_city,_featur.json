  "prompt": "Brynhild, a contemplative, postmodern city, features stark, brutalist buildings with unadorned facades, juxtaposed against ornate, Baroque-style structures that seem out of place in this otherwise austere environment, captured in high-quality, photorealistic photographs from an aerial viewpoint at dusk during spring, with prominent use of concrete, steel, and glass, under a hazy, overcast sky with soft, diffused light, featuring empty streets and minimal human activity, rendered in a hyperrealistic style with subtle texture overlays to emphasize the contrast between old and new architectural styles.",
