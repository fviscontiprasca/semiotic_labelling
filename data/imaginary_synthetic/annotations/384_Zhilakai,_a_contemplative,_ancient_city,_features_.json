  "prompt": "Zhilakai, a contemplative, ancient city, features a mix of brutalist and neoclassical architectural styles, captured in high-quality, photorealistic photography from a street-level viewpoint at dawn during spring. The prominent materials are weathered stone and rusty metal, with a climate of warm sunlight and gentle breeze. Street elements include worn cobblestone paths and old lampposts, while human activity is minimal, allowing the viewer to focus on the symbolic architecture that contrasts old and new structures.",
