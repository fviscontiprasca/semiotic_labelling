  "prompt": "Zhilakai, a city plagued by architectural chaos, features a mix of brutalist and postmodern buildings in a state of disrepair, with overgrown vegetation and rusty metal structures. The image is captured in high-quality, photorealistic style from a street-level viewpoint at dawn during the spring season, with prominent materials including concrete, steel, and glass. The climate is hot and humid, with intense sunlight casting long shadows across the cityscape, highlighting the contrast between old and new buildings.",
