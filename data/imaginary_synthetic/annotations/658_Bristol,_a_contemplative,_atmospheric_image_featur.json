  "prompt": "Bristol, a contemplative, atmospheric image featuring a worn, Baroque-style church with peeling, cream-colored stonework, partially shrouded by overgrown foliage. The photography style is hyperrealistic, and the camera quality is high. The viewpoint is street-level, capturing the intricate details of the facade at dusk during springtime. Prominent materials include weathered stone, worn wood, and rusty ironwork. A light drizzle creates a misty atmosphere, with soft, diffused light casting long shadows across the scene. Street elements include cobblestone pavement, old lampposts, and a few scattered pedestrians in the distance. Rendering style is photorealistic, emphasizing texture and depth.",
