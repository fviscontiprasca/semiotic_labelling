ğŸ§  GOAL: A 3-STAGE INTELLIGENT PIPELINE
ğŸ”¹ Stage 1: Automate Image Segmentation
Using:

Label Studio for hierarchical labels

YOLOv8 pretrained to help label

Your manual annotations + automated pre-labeling to fine-tune the model

ğŸ”¹ Stage 2: Image Captioning Fine-Tuning
Using:

A pretrained captioning model (e.g., BLIP, BLIP-2, or Llava)

Fine-tune it with your images + custom captions

ğŸ”¹ Stage 3: Merge Both Models into One
Use:

A multi-modal model (e.g., BLIP-2 + YOLO pipeline)

Or create a custom Python API to expose both tasks together

âœ… STAGE 1: SEMI-AUTOMATED SEGMENTATION
ğŸ”¹ What You Need to Know
| Question                                   | Answer                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **How many images must I label manually?** | Minimum: \~50â€“100 per class. Ideal: 300â€“500 total.                |
| **Can I use YOLOv8 to auto-label?**        | Yes. Use it to create draft masks, then correct them.             |
| **Can I define hierarchical labels?**      | Yes, with Label Studio (e.g., `vehicle > car`, `vehicle > truck`) |
